# Terraform & Azure Lab: The Cloud Resume Challenge

Welcome to my walkthrough series for the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/). 

This series provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for setting up and configuring a fully functional static website hosted on Azure Blob Storage, along with a Linux Azure Virtual Machine (VM) serving a simple Flask API.

In this project, all resources are provisioned using Terraform, implementing IaC (Infrastructure as Code) strategies. Additionally, the static website is automatically updated through a GitHub Actions workflow, which triggers on every push to the repository, demonstrating a seamless CI/CD pipeline.

This initiative is a part of my DevOps portfolio intended to demonstrate the skills I've developed in cloud infrastructure management, automation, and continuous integration and deployment methodologies.

##### Series overview

This walkthrough consists of three parts:

1. [ðŸ–‰CRC Part 1: Hosting a static website on Azure Blob Storage](https://github.com/0xtr1gger/cloud_resume_challenge/blob/main/walkthrough/Part_1_Hosting_a_static_website_on_Azure_Blob_Storage.md)
2. ðŸ–‰CRC Path 2: Configuring a GitHub Actions workflow
3. ðŸ–‰CRC Part 3: Creating an Azure VM for the API

Happy reading and coding!
